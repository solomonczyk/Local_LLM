# Coding Rules (apply to this repository)

## Output format
- Start with: Conclusions
- Then: Details
- Then: Risks
- Then: Improvements
- End with: Next Step (one concrete action)

## Change policy
- Do NOT rewrite large files without asking.
- Prefer minimal diffs.
- Keep changes reversible.
- If you need to refactor: propose a plan first.

## Engineering
- Add/keep tests when behavior changes.
- Follow existing conventions in the repo.
- Never commit secrets (.env, keys, tokens).
